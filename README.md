# Merkle MultiProof and SingleProof Inputs Generation For Forge

This simple library generates Merkle MultiProof and SingleProof inputs for OpenZeppelin's [`MerkleProof (v5.0.0)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol) library. It is written in Solidity and can be used in the Forge framework. The library has been tested to work with at most 10k arbitrary leaves and arbitrary indices of any size.

## Usage

See [`MerkleGen.t.sol`](./test/MerkleGen.t.sol) for example:
- Import the `MerkleGen` library.
- Prepare the leaves and indices.
- Call `generateMultiproof` to generate the MultiProof or `generateSingleProof` to generate the SingleProof inputs.

A wrapper Prover library is provided in `Prover.sol`, which forwards all the inputs to OpenZeppelin's `MerkleProof` library.

## How to run tests

The following command will run a standard test and a (pretty long) fuzzing test of 100k runs. To modify the number of runs, change the `runs` parameter in `foundry.toml`.

```
forge test
```
